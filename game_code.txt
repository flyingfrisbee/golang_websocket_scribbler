this is what each code sent from client -> server does:

- 0: Clear drawing from canvas (handled from client) -> send to all players except currently drawing
- 1: drawing coordinates from client (handled from client) -> send to all players except currently drawing
- 2: Continue turn => Words = Words[1:], cek juga buat end game klo gaada kata lagi.
    turn number++. currentlydrawing = for loop cari UID dengan Order = turnNumber % len(Clients). updategamestat
- 3: Submit answer (format: "3,UID,answer")
- 4: Game has ended (triggered from continue turn but no words left -> send '4' to client)
